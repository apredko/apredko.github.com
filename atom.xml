    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>I had a real person day</h2>

<p>Today was the day I broke up with a partner of three and a half years. It&#8217;s funny thinking of all the time you can spend with a person over long periods of time. Thinking of all the hours and days and weeks all seeping into one long moment in time. I guess for that moment that I sat there I was strong held by my conviction, as I&#8217;ve never been one to share words about my feelings verbally. But as I sat there I knew what I was doing, finally able to release the tension in my chest and give into my feelings. All things considered, today was a good day.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>They&#8217;re amazing</h2>

<p>So last friday I got something that has seriously changed my life for the better. I got a blue pencil. For months now I&#8217;ve been drawing only in pen, convinced that if I couldn&#8217;t commit myself to a single line than it didn&#8217;t deserve to be drawn. Blue pencils have changed this. I now find great enjoyment in drawing the most delicate line I can, slow sculpting a figure out of nothing instead of getting frustrated at my lack of line perfecting and giving up. I&#8217;ve found it most freeing. It gives me new motivation to work on pieces, and that makes me very excited.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>Actually Not That Hard</h2>

<p>I thought I had lost all of my blog posts, but actually, git has saved my ass. I made the last two posts last week and tried to upload them, but for some reason my Virtualbox decided it didn&#8217;t want to connect to the internet anymore. After trying a restart I kept getting a kernel issue that I didn&#8217;t understand. Seems it&#8217;s actually just as easy to reinstall VB to solve the problem. So now I have all my files, despite the fact that I had to do all this. I am actually so relieved. I am being converted, ever so slowly.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>I am the WORST at going to concerts</h2>

<p>So I do love music. I really really do, it&#8217;s just that I&#8217;m not that great at leaving my house to go outside and actually going to the concerts. I don&#8217;t know what it is, the standing in a crowd, smelling all these random bodies and feeling their breath all around you. I just can&#8217;t motivate myself to go out and actually do it. Oh well. Well now I&#8217;ll just buy the EP of the bands I was going to check out and enjoy their music while supported them from the comfort of my own basement.</p>

<p>and now I&#8217;m making my GM come over and watch me make blog posts. I don&#8217;t know what this says about my social life, but it makes me happy.</p>
